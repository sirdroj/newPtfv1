          I am a Full-Stack Software Developer and Machine Learning Engineer
          with hands-on experience across backend development, frontend
          frameworks, and scalable AI/ML systems. I specialize in building
          production-grade APIs using FastAPI and Django, deploying
          high-performance ML inference pipelines with vLLM and NVIDIA Triton,
          and crafting intelligent RAG-based applications leveraging LangChain,
          LangGraph, and ChromaDB. With a strong foundation in data structures,
          distributed systems, and DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and
          Prometheus, I excel at developing and deploying end-to-end solutions.
          Iâ€™ve successfully delivered real-time financial engines, large-scale
          audio processing services, and LLM-powered agents in production
          environments. Passionate about innovation, I combine deep technical
          proficiency with a problem-solving mindset to drive impact across AI
          and full-stack development projects.
