      "So Far At my current job, Iâ€™ve worked on improving different parts of our AI systems. I fine-tuned a smaller, faster version of the Mistralai/Mistral-7B model to give better responses and understand goals more accurately. I also improved our speech recognition service by making it use 25% less memory and run 15% faster. To make audio clearer for users, I added a noise cancellation feature that improved sound quality by 20%. I helped build tools like Note Taker and Minutes of Meeting, and tested more than 15 different language models to find the best ones for our needs, including smaller, faster versions using Ollama. I also set up servers using VLLM and Triton to run these models smoothly and handle a lot of requests at once.",

      "I developed AI-powered financial applications like Sentient, a stocks exploration and backtesting tool, and OMS, an Order Management System. By optimizing both the backend and frontend using FastAPI, Django, and React.js, I reduced manual workflows by 50%. I also managed server deployment on Hostinger VPS, ensuring 99.9% uptime. Additionally, I built a finance-specialized chatbot using RAG models, OpenAI, and ChromaDB, enhancing query resolution by 70%. To improve real-time financial insights, I implemented web scraping techniques, which increased sentiment analysis accuracy to 90%.",
