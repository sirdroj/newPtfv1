      "So Far At my current job, Iâ€™ve worked on improving different parts of our AI systems. I fine-tuned a smaller, faster version of the Mistralai/Mistral-7B model to give better responses and understand goals more accurately. I also improved our speech recognition service by making it use 25% less memory and run 15% faster. To make audio clearer for users, I added a noise cancellation feature that improved sound quality by 20%. I helped build tools like Note Taker and Minutes of Meeting, and tested more than 15 different language models to find the best ones for our needs, including smaller, faster versions using Ollama. I also set up servers using VLLM and Triton to run these models smoothly and handle a lot of requests at once.",
